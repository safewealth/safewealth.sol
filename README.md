# safewealth.sol
SafeWealth contract SafeWealth protocol is a mixture of RFI tokenomics with the added function of auto-liquidity generating protocol. A fork from SafeMoon with some added benefits. First, the developer has minted the tokens - sent the balance to DxSale for fair launch - and then burned the remainder of the tokens. Developer had to partake in presale. Second, utilized the DxSale protocol to foster trust in the community by auto-locking liquidity for 6 years. Simple tokenomics and elegant design and production of token information has catered to the overall success of the project. 100% community owned and driven - no rug is possible. #SafeWealth join us on our mission to become Wealthy on Planet Earth!
