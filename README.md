SafeWealth Contract 
The SafeWealth protocol is a mixture of RFI tokenomics featuring a manual burn strategy and an automatic liquidity pool. A fork from a popular cryptocurrency with additional benefits. First of all, the developer has created the coins - will send the balance to DxSale for fair launch - and then burn the remainder of the coins. The developer will partake in the presale like everyone else. Secondly, the developer will utilize the DxSale protocol to foster trust in the community by automatically locking liquidity for four years. Simple tokenomics and functional design and production of coin information will cater to the project's overall success. SafeWealth is a community-inspired platform that focuses on creating long-term wealth to create a better tomorrow. #SafeWealth join us on our mission to become Wealthy on Planet Earth!
